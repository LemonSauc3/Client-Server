# Client-Server
Basic Client-Server model using python, that takes commands and will proceed to process and modify a .csv file.

This project is based off a school assigment, where it is acting as a DBMS with a multi-client's connecting to one server on the localhost, and allowing the server to handle all of the requests.

This project requires:
-pandas
-csv
-random
-socket
-threading




# ToDo List:
->add random name generator, based on the names.txt
->fix insert
->add update, and delete options
->Create a CLI 'GUI'
->fix closing
->add server shutdown command to the Client.py
